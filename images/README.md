## Image Optimization Tips

1. **Compress images** before uploading to ensure fast page loading
2. Use **WebP format** if possible (with fallbacks)
3. **Alt text** is already included in HTML for accessibility
4. Maintain **consistent aspect ratios** within each category
5. Use **professional photography** for hero and service images

## Fallback Behavior

If images are missing, the website will:
- Display fallback text for brand logos
- Show gray placeholder backgrounds for product/service images
- Continue to function normally without breaking the layout
